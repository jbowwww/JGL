TODO:

General:
	- Convert this Features.txt and the one in DCT project into spreadsheet(s) with time estimates, actuals, dates, etc
		- Don't have to stick to it like glue but would be good to get an idea of where you spent time/ should plan to etc

JGL.Heirarchy
	- Mesh derived types like Box, Cube, Sphere(how to do manually if cant auto generate?), Square (in 3d space),
	Grid (2D Rectangle with specified number of vertices per dimension - could derive a Terrain type from here)
		D- Box done a few weeks ago (typed here 20/7/13)
		D- Quad done today 20/7/13

	- Mesh construction from multiple meshes, merges vertex data from each input mesh Added 5/7/13
		- First attempt implemented but not tested yet (20/7/13)

JGL.Heiararchy.Scene
	- Static member called All that contains all Scene derived instances Added 5/7/13

JGL
	- Some kind of performance/timing capabilities? Added 5/7/13

JGL.Resource - Added 6/7/13
	- Resource abstract base class
		- Texture
			- Seems to be working (although the texture coordinates generated for my Box type look wrong) / Looks OK on Quad - D 20/7/13
		- AudioSample
		- File ??
			- e.g. 3d models, sounds, maps, xml, binary, whatever
			- could hold the original resource (or enough of it as required) to be able to quickly create instantiations (Entity derived) for insertion into the heirarchy.
				- Create multiple instantiations quickly, whenever, wherever in whatever heirarchy
				- A JGL.Resource.File class may (!) be a good starting point for some kind of standardisation for loading Entities/other resources from files
					- Maybe not Resource-derived, maybe jsut a JGL.File class for same purpose?
